      "answer": "My first motivation for this site was to learn the Context API. I later experimented with Redux thunks and sagas. I have also added a semi-secret admin page that employs AWS Amplify for Cognito authentication and the ability to upload photos directly from the site. For a while I had been limited to uploading via shell scripts that plugged into the AWS SDK."
