      "question": "What technologies does this site use?",
      "answer": "I began using the Context API. I then switched to Redux. I also added a semi-secret admin page that employs AWS Amplify for Cognito authentication and the ability to upload photos directly from the site. For a while I had been limited to uploading via shell scripts that plugged into the AWS SDK."

      "answer": "Pretty websites are time-consuming to make and styling is not a priority for this one. This is a \"code playground\" of sorts, but CSS is something I need to get paid to think deeply about."
