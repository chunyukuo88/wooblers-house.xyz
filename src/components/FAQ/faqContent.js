(Before that I used <span style="${emphasisColor}">shell scripts</span> that plugged into the <span style="${emphasisColor}">AWS SDK</span>.)</p><p>I add whatever technologies strike my fancy, like <span style="${emphasisColor}">Google Analytics,</span> <span style="${emphasisColor}">mustache</span> templates or the <span style="${emphasisColor}">SVG animations</span> below.</p><p>This domain was registered via <span style="${emphasisColor}">Route 53</span>.</p>`,
